# Computer Graphics Algorithms in java

This repository contains most of my lab works of Computer Graphics Course(CSE423). The codework can be found in the *[src folder](https://github.com/sajjad-ahmed/Computer-Graphics-Algorithms/tree/master/src)* directory

## Contents:
- DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
- Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm
- Mid Point Line Drawing Algorithm
- Cohen Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm
- Eight Way Symmetry Circle Drawing Algorithm
- Drawing Square using DDA
- Drawing Square using Mid Point
- Drawing Star using Mid Point
- Drawing WoW emo using Circle

## Dependencies:
The following jars are used in this codework and they are required:
- `jogl-all.jar`
- `jogl-all-natives-{linux or windows}.jar`
- `glugen-rt.jar`
- `glugen-rt-natives-{linux or windows}.jar`
>  **Libraries are available at [lib](/lib) directory**
